This is just for messing around and learning Unity.

This was for the game jam ISOU by Artindi but I didn't make the deadline
so I gave myself another few weeks.

Game is about microbes in a microscope.

I have decided I want to transition to Godot so I have decided to leave it how it is now and
stop here instead of dedicating more time to learn Unity when I could be learning Godot.

Game is admittedly not finished nor very good but hey, its my first one.

Big thanks to Sebastian Lague's platformer tutorial that I have re-purposed to fit my requirements
