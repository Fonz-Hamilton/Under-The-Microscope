This is just for messing around and learning Unity.

Big thanks to Sebastian Lague's platformer tutorial that I have re-purposed to fit my requirements 

This was for the game jam ISOU by Artindi but I didn't make the deadline
so I'm giving myself another week (er, more than that...).

Game is about microbes in a microscope

Will learn Godot for the next one
